# Sample Hardhat-Foundry Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat develop suite with foundry testing framework build in. It comes with a sample contract, test cases for both hardhat and foundry, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
```
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
or
forge test
```
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts

```
